# Wildlife-Zoo
CS 210 Wildlife Zoo RFID Tracker Program (Project 3)

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project tasked us with writing a C++ application that integrated the JVM. It was required that the program had a menu, Generated Data, Loaded Data from a file, Saved Data to a file, Displayed the data in the console, Added and Deleted individual records.

What did you do particularly well?
My use of classes and functions to reduce reduntand code came together well. For the most part, I was very happy with how the types and subtypes inheretance worked out.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I was unable to get some created error-handling code implemented. I left it in the class I created for it (ValidateEntry.cpp) but when I tried to integrate it into my data entry on the main application it was non-functional. These improvements would not only reduce my redundant code, it would make it more secure and less-sucesptable to error in data entry.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
This was a very involved piece of code for an eight week intro class, in my opinion. I relied heavily on partial solutions found on stackoverflow and cplusplus.com forums. I also have previous experience with C++ and other Object-Oriented programming. Without those tools and skills I would not have gotten the program to the point that it is. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
It remains to be seen, but in my time with software development, cross language integration hasn't been something I've encountered very frequently. The use of classes and functions to distribtue and re-use the redunant code is very transferable to other projects, and who know what the future holds.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I feel that my use of extra functions and classes to reduce redundant code is the most impactful in making this program maintainable, readable and adaptable. Wherever possible, industry standard terms were used (i =0 unsigned int counters for instance) and combined with my comments the code is hopefully easily maintabale and readable not only by me but by any other developers.
